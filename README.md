================

You learn how to use R, or SQL in Jupyter notebook 

First we need an IRkernal insatlled 

i.	To install the IRkernel package by running the following command in an R console: Install.packages(‘IRKernel’)

ii.	  And the final step is to make the kernel available to Jupyter , so Jupyter can see the R kernel by setting up the user to False using this command:  IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)
